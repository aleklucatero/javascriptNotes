# javascriptNotes

The point of this repository is to show my progress of learning Javascript. I am adding code and then commenting it out as I commit new changes. I started a bit late, as I didn't think to do this with the other 2000+ lines of practice code that I have written. The file is not supposed to run as a program, but as a guide and a progress tracker on every topic in Javascript that I have learned and will learn. Most topics are titled before they start. You will most likely be able to CTRL+F any JS topic and it'll be on here.
